			<h1>War The Card Game!</h1>
			<article>
				<p>The card game of war is a classic card game where two or more players place down a card from their hand. Whoever has the highest card value (Ace being the highest) wins those cards. At the end of the game, whoever has the most cards wins. I have just recreated the game for Mac, Windows, and Linux so you don't need a deck of cards to play.</p>

			<h1>Gamemodes</h1>
			<article>
				<p>In my version of the game, there are two gamemodes: Endless and Quick. In Endless Gamemode, when the cards in your hand run out, you'll put the cards you won into your hand so you keep playing. This gamemode is potentially endless, hence the name. If any player has zero cards in their hand and has no cards in their Won pile, the game ends and the other player wins. In quick mode, the game ends when either player runs out of cards in their hand.</p>
